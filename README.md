# ProjectK

Create a login and sign up page where the user can login using his phone number or through Google Login.



Use FirebaseAuth module to implement this. Post login the user should be directed to an activity with a Tab Layout with Four Tabs Named - Certificate,Profile, Chat, and Score (In this order).



User should be directed to the Profile tab upon log in.



In the profile tab there should be ‘Win Certificate’ button.



On clicking the button a new activity will open which will show a Question - Tell me About Yourself? And below it a space to answer the question.



Also a timer will start with a countdown of 30 seconds . As soon as the countdown the space to write the question will get blocked and the user will be presented with a button to submit the answer.



Share the git repo and the apk on completion.



Please note:

The code should be written in Java and not Kotlin

Ensure lifecycle methods are appropriately handled.
